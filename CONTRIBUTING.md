Here are some basic things to keep in mind

## ARCSlots design goals
* ARCSlots should be as user friendly as possible
* ARCSlots should be as configurable as possible _in-game_ without the need for configuration files:

## Things that I've always wanted to do but never got around to it.
* **APP API NEEDS AN OVERHAULED AND MUST BE DOCUMENTED**
* Make the addon compatible with the ARCLib translation system
* Better phone customizability
* An entity which allows cops or something to listen in on people's phone calls. (That's what the server was supposed to be)
