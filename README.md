## Why free?
Well, I haven't been actively providing quality customer support and proper maintenence for my addons for quite some time. But since a lot of time and effort has been put a lot in this one, I don't want to just seal it away. I hope the community can take on the challange with making this better.

## It's here!

This is it. ARCPhone. The next big thing from the creator of ARitz Cracker Bank. Development started sometime before the release of "rPhone" with one thing in mind, the same thing that made ARCBank popular. Immersion. The phone would be something you would hold in your hand, not some 2D image on a screen. The ARCPhone is built to be 3D, simple, unique, have lots of customization options, and best of all, have realistic reception.

## The incomplete list of features!

* ARCBank App!
  * Transfer funds, or manage your group account with ease!
* NutScript compatibility! Each Character (not player) will have a unique phone number.

* If your gamemode doesn't have 3D voice chat or text chat with players near you simply use the following settings.
  * `override_text_chat` This will only allow you to talk to people near you. (1000 units) there are no PM commands or anything like that. That's what phone calls and SMS are for
  * `override_voice_chat` This will force 3D voice chat to be enabled (unless in a phone call)
